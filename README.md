# Naming Unconvention

### This mod replaces your generic "New World (213.7)" world name with a randomly generated one, something like Terraria ones.
- You can modify adjectives, nouns, locations and compositions of these names through a resource pack - assets/naming_unconvention/<adjectives/nouns/locations/compositions>.txt
- The mod comes pre-configured with 75 adjectives, nouns and locations, and 8 compositions.
